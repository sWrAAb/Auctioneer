[Heroku Live - The Auctioneer](https://the-auctioneer.herokuapp.com)

## UX Testing

- To easily find what I am looking for, I want the layout of the site to make sense so I am not confused or put off using it.

- Navbar is laid out in the conventional way:

- Navbar is at the top of the screen.

- The primary purpose of the site - webshop and auction - are easily found in the navbar.

- The footer is also laid out in a conventional way.

- Contact information and links are provided in the footer.

- Social media links also provided in the footer where the user would expect to find them.

- The information I am presented with to be laid out in a way that is easy for me to navigate, so that I find what I need quickly and efficiently.

- The page is broken up into easy to understand sections, and the data displayed in a way that is most easy to read.

- Tables and icons are used where applicable, which all aid in easily accessible information for the user.
- As a user accessing this site from a mobile phone or tablet, I want the site designed responsively so that it is still easy to navigate and use on my smaller devices. 

The Auctioneer was carefully planned and designed to be responsive and work well on mobile, tablet and desktop devices.
